**⚠️ Disclaimer (aka The Fun Part):**

This was a passion project whipped up for a class assignment. Security? Let's just say it's more "demo" than Fort Knox. There might be some quirky code and email-based data fetching (for easy debugging, of course!). Use at your own risk, and definitely don't store your deepest, darkest secrets here. 😜

**Why I Made This (Besides the Grade):**

I wanted to give my fellow students a fun, accessible way to explore the fascinating world of dreams and sleep. Plus, who doesn't love playing with AI?

Happy dreaming (and coding)! ✌️
